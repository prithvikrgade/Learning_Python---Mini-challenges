## sometimes you might get confused on the use pf paranthese, like when to use it and when not to use it.
1. when you are trying to call a function like list.insert() or liste.append() or dictionary.keys or dictionary.items() 
2. You are telling python "Hey run this action now!" and those methods must be followed by  parantheses 
3. But when you are trying to access Dictionaries or lists ot tuples 
4. Say dictionary or lists[0] or dictionary["satus"] you dont need parantheses
## These are data structures not functions so you dont call them 

### ðŸ§  If it does something (like .lower(), .items(), .append()), it needs "()"

### ðŸ“¦ If it just holds data (like a list or dict), it doesnâ€™t need "()"
